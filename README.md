# NPNDOS

A DDOS script with many options, such as TCP/UDP IP checking, with some adjustments, but not too aggressive because some commands are still too vulnerable. I just hope you like it.

a little story about the name of this script:

The name of this script is from the woman's real name which I disguised, I know her, she's good even though I've never met her in person, at one point I thought we were together, it turned out I was just her escape, after a while I found out that she already had a new man, I'm not sad, just a little disappointed, if you see this I apologize for not being able to accompany you anymore, my heart always hurts when I see you with your new man 

see you again in another life☺️
